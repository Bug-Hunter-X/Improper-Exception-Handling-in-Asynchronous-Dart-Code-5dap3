# Dart Asynchronous Exception Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Dart code involving asynchronous operations and exception handling. The example shows how to improve exception handling for better error management in your applications.

## Bug Description
The provided Dart code attempts to fetch data from a remote API asynchronously. However, its exception handling is insufficient. It doesn't differentiate between various exception types and doesn't provide specific context for errors, making debugging difficult.

## Solution
The solution involves improving the `try-catch` block to handle different exception types separately. By providing informative error messages and handling each type of exception appropriately, developers can diagnose issues more effectively and prevent unexpected application crashes.
